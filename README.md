# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio.

This repository showcases hands-on labs and practical security projects focused on Linux hardening, access control, log analysis, and security investigations.

My objective is to build real-world technical skills aligned with SOC, Cloud Security, and Infrastructure Security roles.

## About Me

I am a cybersecurity student focused on developing strong foundations in:

- Linux system security
- Access control enforcement
- SQL-based log analysis
- Cloud & Infrastructure security fundamentals

I actively practice through structured labs and document each project following professional security reporting standards.

# Projects

## 1️⃣ Linux File Permissions & Access Control Audit

📁 `linux/file-permissions`

Simulated a filesystem security audit in a Linux environment to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP).

### Key Actions

- Audited file and directory permissions using `ls -la`
- Identified over-permissive configurations
- Applied secure changes using `chmod`
- Reduced attack surface
- Verified post-hardening security posture

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- POSIX permission model
- Octal & symbolic notation
- Linux CLI auditing
- Access control hardening
- Security documentation

---

## 2️⃣ SQL Security Log Investigation

📁 `sql/security-investigation`

Conducted a simulated security investigation analyzing login attempts and employee records.

### Key Actions

- Detected failed login attempts
- Identified activity outside business hours
- Filtered employee data by department and location
- Applied logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- Used pattern matching (LIKE)

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- SQL data filtering
- Log investigation methodology
- Security-focused data analysis
- Technical documentation
